js-vido â€” JavaScript Video Download Optimizer
=============================================

A JavaScript library for optimizing html pages with video content that prevents videos from loading on mobile devices.

What it does
------------

Prevents videos with the "optimize-video" class from being downloaded to mobile devices by displaying the poster image instead. This is done by creating the source element of the video node through the data-src attribute only in case the device used is a laptop or desktop computer.

One of the cases where this functionality can be useful is verified with auto-play videos used in web page backgrounds, because auto-play does not work on mobile devices, the video would be downloaded unnecessarily, slowing down the loading of the page and consuming mobile data.

Usage
-----

1. In the video node add the following attributes:
   - class="optimize-video"
   - poster="poster source" (image displayed on mobile)
   - data-src="video source"
   - data-type="video type"
2. Import the js library at the end of the body node:
   - `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ariel-mn/js-vido@1.0.0/js-vido.js" integrity="sha256-aLD7G9V/25SfpmWNWLbcGblvtThOEb21GpDUKuHXqD8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`

Example
-------

```html
<!-- Optimized Video -->
<video class="optimize-video" autoplay muted loop poster="https://image.jpeg" data-src="https://video.mp4" data-type="video/mp4"></video>

<!-- js-vido -->
